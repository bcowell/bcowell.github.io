                                <b>Introduction:</b>
                                These past two semesters I have had the privilege to work for the Computing and Communication Services (CCS) at the University of Guelph. 
                                This write-up is here to provide you with a peak at my work experiences. 
                                Here I review some of the skills I learned, the new technologies I used, and the goals I set for each work-term on my way through my undergraduate program.

                                <br>
                                <br><b>About CCS:</b>
                                Computing and Communication Services (CCS) provides a large variety of IT services to it's University campuses and their partners.
                                These include internet connectivity, a campus-wide integrated email and calendaring system, telephones, printers, cheap development software for students, learning resources, and much more. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uoguelph.ca/ccs/">Here</a> is a link to their website.

                                <br>
                                <br><b>Job Description:</b>
                                My job title at CCS was Junior Developer.
                                I worked as part of a small team of Senior Analysts in Human Resources of the Enterprise Applications section of CCS. 
                                I was tasked to develop, re-theme, and service a few of the University's HR related web applications.
                                The University of Guelph has plans to move to a new HR Management system to new servers within the next few years.
                                <br>

                                <br><b>Work:</b>
                                I spent a fair amount of time migrating old applications in Apex into a new theme in preparation of migration to Apex 5.<br>
                                Another of my accomplishments was the complete refactoring of one of our Apex pages. 
                                The Appointments page was a behemoth of spaghetti code. I found redundant and reused queries, unnecessary computations and many parts were difficult to understand.
                                Of the first things to go; 
                                A dynamic procedure that queried all the page items individually and then set them as global (application level) variables, where they would be referenced with page-level substitution variables.
                                Other problems included obscure and unnecessarily lengthy code segments. I wanted to improve on the general readability for future debugging.
                                The old Apex page was trying to do too much all at once. It worked by having many regions that it would restrict based on a passed request, thus making it very difficult to debug.
                                I managed to separate two similar operations (Adding a new appointment and promoting an appointment) and created a new page, reducing the mess.
                                In the end I managed to reduce much of the old clutter without losing any functionality.<br><br>

                                Additionally I wrote many PL/SQL procedures and functions. For example, my team was working on a tool to help expedite an existing payment process for our users. 
                                So, given the types of input parameters and the expected output. I wrote the code so that it could be easily integrated into our current system.
                                One of my procedures is used to determine the file-types of BLOBs (a collection of binary data stored as a single object in a database). Each file has a hex signature stored in the beginning of its encoding.
                                So my procedure read through the first 8 or 16 bytes of the raw blob file and recognized the file-type. 
                                <br><br>
                                A memorable highlight was when we received C code from an outside software distributor that wouldn't 
                                compile on our payroll system, I found the code segments causing the errors and re-wrote them so that it would compile.
                                And by doing so, saved over a week of time before the software distributor responded to emails.
                                <br><br>
                                
                                <b>Goals:</b><br> 
                                <b>I will have an intermediate understanding of relational Databases and the client-server model.</b><br>
                                Action Plan: Get introduced to the Database tool (Toad) the HR team uses for SQL and DB development within my first week.
                                By my second week start using Toad to look through the Schema Browser and understand the connection between a server and the actual data stored.
                                We constantly use Git for version control of our applications. This helps us distinguish our three servers and maintain merges and branches between them.<br>
                                Measure of Success: CIS*3530 is a Computer Science course on Database Systems and Concepts.The course is a study of data organization and data management principles with the perspective 
                                of analysing applications relevant for a Database Management System (DBMS). My goal is to learn enough on an actual system and as a result be successful in CIS*3530; which will be  reflected in my grade at the end of the class.

                                <br><br><b>I will be proficient at SQL and PL/SQL.</b><br>
                                Action Plan: By my second week I was introduced to the SQL DML (Data Manipulation Language) statements through mind maps.
                                Got introduced on a test Table that Jim and Alan setup on one of our databases. Where I was able to practice basic commands with no negative effects.
                                May 20th Began PL/SQL Quick reference mind map which I plan on continually updating.
                                On June 3rd I started creating a new APEX application where I am responsible for rewriting and possibly creating new PL/SQL statements.<br>
                                Measure of Success:	Ability to write short pieces of code that query our database for challenges that I create myself.
                                Alan introduced me to PLSQLchallenge.com a quiz game where people answer PL/SQL questions to score points and win prizes.
                                Able to quickly rework existing Non-ANSI sql joins into proper ANSI join statements.<br>
                                Reflection:	Sometimes I will come up with a problem to give myself and write the query for it. Some examples are; Finding the longest employee lastname, number of professors, and the amount of male/female employees. So far I have mostly been writing simple queries and revising queries in existing APEX applications. However soon I hope to be able to write advanced SQL and PL/SQL code by myself.

                                <br><br><b>I will be an experienced APEX developer by the end of my work-term.</b><br>
                                Action Plan: Introduced a few small changes on a data entry APEX application with Jim in mid May.
                                May 5th - 7th, APEX exposed conference in Montreal.
                                June 3rd, Began developing an APEX app "Appointments" cloning an existing app as a template.
                                Within the next few months I will be migrating existing applications from their old templates to a new template.<br>
                                Measure of Success: APEXposed was a 3-day conference in Montreal hosted by Oracle to learn about Application Express (APEX) 5.0.
                                I created the new "Appointments" application by copying an existing app we had as a base. Since then I have removed a lot of unnecessary items and have created/updated many new features.
                                    
                                <br><br><b>Conclusion:</b><br>
                                Overall I was very happy with what I was able to accomplish in my time at the University and thoroughly enjoyed working with the HR crew.
                                Working as a developer, I felt I learned a great deal about Oracle's Application Express (Apex), JavaScript, the Chrome developer tools, and the client-server model.
                                Lastly I would like to sincerely thank CCS, Enterprise Applications, and the Human Resources team for their help in making my first work term a success.<br><br>
                                <b>It was a pleasure working with you Jim, Alan, and Bruce!</b>

                                <b>Introduction:</b>
                                For my second work term, I was hired on a 4 month co-op for Student Life Services at the University of Guelph. This write-up is for you to get a sense of what Student Life does, my role there, and the things I learned while working for the University of Guelph.
                                <br><br>
                                <b>About Student Life:</b> Student Life assists the University of Guelph by offering programs and services that help students make successful transitions to, through and from university life and study. It is comprised of the Aboriginal Resource Centre, Community Engagement & Global Citizenship, Centre for New Students, Directors Office, Off-Campus Living, and Intercultural Affairs. Here is a link to their website. 
                                <br><br>
                                <b>Work:</b> As a web developer at Student Life most of my efforts were focused on three websites.
                                <br><br>
                                
                                <b>Orientation Week 2016</b><br>
                                A website for new students to view all of the events planned for this year's orientation.
                                Primarily I was involved with fixing pre-existing bugs and adding a few small enhancements.
                                <br><br>
                                <b>STARTonline.ca</b><br>
                                STARTonline.ca contains valuable information for new students coming to Guelph. Explore campus organizations, services, and read about the experiences of other students. It also has many parent resources, news about orientation week, and a place to ask any questions. Independently built from requirements while focusing heavily on accessibility. 
                                <br><br>
                                
                                <b>Studentlife.uoguelph.ca</b><br>
                                As part of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA), Student Life's website needed a large overhaul to fix accessibility issues. In addition to making the site accessible, I also implemented a new layout and created an instructional guide on keeping posts accessible.
                                <br><br>
                                
                                <b>Goals:</b>
                                <br>
                                <b>I would like to improve my communication on a technical skill level.</b><br>
                                I can achieve this by participating in stand up meetings as well as holding technical demonstrations for my supervisor and various managers weekly.
                                <br><br>
                                
                                <b>By the end of my first month I will be proficient with the Drupal platform.</b><br>
                                I will study the training videos from Drupalize.me during my first week. In my second week, I will attend Drupal training workshops taught by members of CCS. Then I will spend time looking through an advanced Drupal site (oweek2016) and reading the custom modules. A good measure of success is being able to quickly and effectively apply changes and additions to either STARTonline.ca, or the orientation-week website. 

                                <br><br>
                                <b>I will finish development and launch STARTonline.ca by June 1st.</b><br>
                                Following the design requirements set by my supervisor, I will design, develop, and launch the full website on or before June 1st. I will be developing and testing on a sandbox site, then pushing the development version live.
                                To finish on schedule I will:
                                Prioritize content. Focus finishing essential pages first. Less important content can be added later if necessary.
                                Do regular check-ins with Monica and Rob. Making sure to adapt to any requirement changes.
                                Fix accessibility issues in waves as content goes up. 
                                <br><br>
                                
                                <b>Conclusion:</b><br>
                                Working for Student Life at the University was a fantastic experience that will definitely further my academic career. In addition to learning the Drupal platform, and speeding up my web development processes, I improved my communication skills with non-technical clients. Overall, I was very glad to work for Student Life. And I'm pleased to say I was offered a position to stay on part-time, which I have accepted.<br><br>
                                <b>Thanks once again to Rob, Monica, Rosanna and the O-team!</b>

                                <b>Introduction:</b>
                                <br>
                                The development process of a website at Sandbox went like this:
                                <br>1. The clients would meet with a project coordinator, designer, and a few developers where the project scope, timeline, cost and difficulty are discussed.
                                <br>2. The designers and developers work together to create a site map and an overview of the website.
                                <br>3. The designer goes through stages of creating what the site is going to look like using wireframing, paper-prototypes, and mockups. Once these have client approval they are made into PSDs.
                                <br>4. The Photoshop documents are given to the developers, who work their magic and produce the website in a series of development stages. Development (dev) -> Testing (test) -> Production (prod)
                                <br>5. After the developers and clients have thoroughly tested and reviews the site it is pushed live!
                                <br>
                                As a Web Developer at Sandbox, I was involved in the later, and largest stages of the project. I was given Photoshop documents (PSDs) of the designs and developed, tested and QA'ed a multitude of websites.
                                <br><br>

                                <br>
                                <b>I will make better use of my time.</b><br>
                                I improved the way I spend my time by; prioritizing the most important issues, scheduling realistic daily and weekly tasks, planning ahead with use of a calendar, getting more sleep, and most importantly drinking more tea.
                                Work at Sandbox was on a very tight schedule. So I made sure sites were ready to go live on their scheduled deployment date.
                                <br><br>

                                <b>I would like to improve my object oriented coding by the end of the work term.</b><br>
                                By focusing on javaScript and Java, watching video tutorials, and by reading guides on the fundamentals of OO. I gained a better understanding of Javascript ES6 and object oriented methods.

                                <br><br>
                                <b>I would like to improve my communication skills by the end of the work term.</b><br>
                                As a developer, contact with non-developers is always a challenge.
                                I find it helps to write down spoken requests, so that I can schedule them in my calendar and better plan ahead to meet project deadlines.
                                I also learned to spend more time implementing priority issues from Project managers.

                                The time I spent developing at Sandbox was very beneficial to my skills at front-end web development. I'm the most proud of my speed at developing has improved.<br><br>

                                Kenna is a marketing solutions provider which specializes in helping businesses design and deliver more unified experiences for customers.
                                During my time at kenna, we have been developing enterprise solutions for <a href="https://www.basf.com/ca/en.html">BASF</a>, the leading chemical producer in the world. 
                                <br><br>

                                <b>Job Overview:</b>
                                At kenna I worked as a full-stack Javascript developer working on various enterprise level web applications.
                                Using agile development I wrote Javascript, jQuery, and AJAX for front-end projects, aswell as built SQL queries and worked with LotusNotes (Visual Basic) for back-end development.
                                <br><br>
                                
                                <b>Work</b><br>

                                Although I mainly was working as a full-stack developer I found front-end work to be much more enjoyable. Having an api to make AJAX calls already inplace made development a breeze. 
                                Who knows, maybe I'll look into just front-end work in the future.
                                <br><br>
                                Kenna is working on switching development frameworks to something more modern.
                                I was lucky that my supervisor, Werner, let me experiment and report my findings on trying out front-end javascript frameworks.
                                Throughout my work term I was able to do demo apps in react, Vue.js, Meteor, Angular, and Backbone!
                                <br><br>
                                At kenna we have what we call a developer "Lunch'n'Learn". 
                                It's a chance for developers to share their knowledge through an hour long course where the company provides lunch.
                                <br><br>
                                During my time at kenna I was fortunate enough to be able to attend a few lunch'n'learns, and even host one myself!
                                At first I was a little scared when my boss asked if I wanted to do a presentation to ALL the developers at kenna.
                                I was working with another senior developer, Brent on a fairly large project where we were doing a lot of client-side data manipulation.
                                We did a bit of research on libraries to use, and eventually chose Underscore.js for it's compatibility with IE10.
                                Being honest we would have chosen lodash, but it only supports down to IE11.
                                <br><br>
                                I found lunch'n'learns to be a great way to learn from other developers on different teams. 
                                Many times they can show you quick solutions that they reached writing different apps that could be really useful to other teams.

                                <br><br>
                                
                                <b>Goals</b><br> 
                                <b>	I would like to gain a better understanding of what it means to be a full stack web developer.</b><br>
                                In the past I've done work terms where I've solely done backend work, or front-end development. I'm very happy to have a chance to learn how both ends fit together. 
                                Gaining a better understanding of full stack will allow me to close the gap between me and the older developers. 

                                <br><br><b>	I would like to improve my JavaScript coding by the end of the work term.</b><br>
                                My first major coding task was to clean up and separate the JavaScript code for session timeout handling of kenna's applications.
                                Previously each app had an individual, slightly different way of handling a user's session. 
                                My task was to create a single generalized function that would be stored in a centralized location. 
                                This way we could remove the old code from each app and simply import / call the function. 
                                I also attended a fantastic in-house course on JavaScript Promises and Callbacks, which I now utilize while writing code. 

                                <br><br><b>I would also like to research and experiment with new frameworks and technologies that could possibly be introduced into kenna's development processes.</b><br>
                                I am mainly interested in the benefits of moving to a Node.js framework.  I spent some time looking through react, Vue.js, Meteor, Angular, and Backbone!
                                As a coop I think it is important to keep an eye on upcoming technologies that could increase productivity and avoid re-creating the wheel. 

                                <br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br>
                                Kenna was great! It was nice to move away from web development and do some full-stack in a real environment.
                                It was also cool to try out agile, and worked much better than I thought it would.
                                Running a lunch'n'learn was a great learning experience. 
                                <br><br>
                                Some skills I furthered: Javascript (Asynchronous and synchronous scheduling, testing, promises and callbacks, AJAX calls.
                                I also got to play with react, Vue.js, Meteor, Angular, and Backbone!
                                <br><br>
                                Kenna definitely has made me a better developer and team-member.
                                <br><br>
                                <b>Thanks everyone at kenna for the great summer!</b>
