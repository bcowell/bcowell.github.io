                                                    <br><b>Job Description:</b>
                                                    My job title at CCS was Junior Developer.
                                                    I worked as part of a small team of Senior Analysts in Human Resources of the Enterprise Applications section of CCS. 
                                                    I was tasked to develop, re-theme, and service a few of the University's HR related web applications.
                                                    The University of Guelph has plans to move to a new HR Management system to new servers within the next few years.
                                                    <br>

                                                    <br><b>Work:</b>
                                                    I spent a fair amount of time migrating old applications in Apex into a new theme in preparation of migration to Apex 5.<br>
                                                    Another of my accomplishments was the complete refactoring of one of our Apex pages. 
                                                    The Appointments page was a behemoth of spaghetti code. I found redundant and reused queries, unnecessary computations and many parts were difficult to understand.
                                                    Of the first things to go; 
                                                    A dynamic procedure that queried all the page items individually and then set them as global (application level) variables, where they would be referenced with page-level substitution variables.
                                                    Other problems included obscure and unnecessarily lengthy code segments. I wanted to improve on the general readability for future debugging.
                                                    The old Apex page was trying to do too much all at once. It worked by having many regions that it would restrict based on a passed request, thus making it very difficult to debug.
                                                    I managed to separate two similar operations (Adding a new appointment and promoting an appointment) and created a new page, reducing the mess.
                                                    In the end I managed to reduce much of the old clutter without losing any functionality.<br><br>

                                                    Additionally I wrote many PL/SQL procedures and functions. For example, my team was working on a tool to help expedite an existing payment process for our users. 
                                                    So, given the types of input parameters and the expected output. I wrote the code so that it could be easily integrated into our current system.
                                                    One of my procedures is used to determine the file-types of BLOBs (a collection of binary data stored as a single object in a database). Each file has a hex signature stored in the beginning of its encoding.
                                                    So my procedure read through the first 8 or 16 bytes of the raw blob file and recognized the file-type. 
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    A memorable highlight was when we received C code from an outside software distributor that wouldn't 
                                                    compile on our payroll system, I found the code segments causing the errors and re-wrote them so that it would compile.
                                                    And by doing so, saved over a week of time before the software distributor responded to emails.

                                                    <b>Goals:</b><br> 
                                                    <b>I will have an intermediate understanding of relational Databases and the client-server model.</b><br>
                                                    Action Plan: Get introduced to the Database tool (Toad) the HR team uses for SQL and DB development within my first week.
                                                    By my second week start using Toad to look through the Schema Browser and understand the connection between a server and the actual data stored.
                                                    We constantly use Git for version control of our applications. This helps us distinguish our three servers and maintain merges and branches between them.<br>
                                                    Measure of Success: CIS*3530 is a Computer Science course on Database Systems and Concepts.The course is a study of data organization and data management principles with the perspective 
                                                    of analysing applications relevant for a Database Management System (DBMS). My goal is to learn enough on an actual system and as a result be successful in CIS*3530; which will be  reflected in my grade at the end of the class.

                                                    <br><br><b>I will be proficient at SQL and PL/SQL.</b><br>
                                                    Action Plan: By my second week I was introduced to the SQL DML (Data Manipulation Language) statements through mind maps.
                                                    Got introduced on a test Table that Jim and Alan setup on one of our databases. Where I was able to practice basic commands with no negative effects.
                                                    May 20th Began PL/SQL Quick reference mind map which I plan on continually updating.
                                                    On June 3rd I started creating a new APEX application where I am responsible for rewriting and possibly creating new PL/SQL statements.<br>
                                                    Measure of Success:	Ability to write short pieces of code that query our database for challenges that I create myself.
                                                    Alan introduced me to PLSQLchallenge.com a quiz game where people answer PL/SQL questions to score points and win prizes.
                                                    Able to quickly rework existing Non-ANSI sql joins into proper ANSI join statements.<br>
                                                    Reflection:	Sometimes I will come up with a problem to give myself and write the query for it. Some examples are; Finding the longest employee lastname, number of professors, and the amount of male/female employees. So far I have mostly been writing simple queries and revising queries in existing APEX applications. However soon I hope to be able to write advanced SQL and PL/SQL code by myself.

                                                    <br><br><b>I will be an experienced APEX developer by the end of my work-term.</b><br>
                                                    Action Plan: Introduced a few small changes on a data entry APEX application with Jim in mid May.
                                                    May 5th - 7th, APEX exposed conference in Montreal.
                                                    June 3rd, Began developing an APEX app "Appointments" cloning an existing app as a template.
                                                    Within the next few months I will be migrating existing applications from their old templates to a new template.<br>
                                                    Measure of Success: APEXposed was a 3-day conference in Montreal hosted by Oracle to learn about Application Express (APEX) 5.0.
                                                    I created the new "Appointments" application by copying an existing app we had as a base. Since then I have removed a lot of unnecessary items and have created/updated many new features.

                                                    Overall I was very happy with what I was able to accomplish in my time at the University and thoroughly enjoyed working with the HR crew.
                                                    Working as a developer, I felt I learned a great deal about Oracle's Application Express (Apex), JavaScript, the Chrome developer tools, and the client-server model.
                                                    Lastly I would like to sincerely thank CCS, Enterprise Applications, and the Human Resources team for their help in making my first work term a success.<br><br>

It is comprised of the Aboriginal Resource Centre, Community Engagement &amp; Global Citizenship, Centre for New Students, Directors Office, Off-Campus Living, and Intercultural Affairs. Here is a link to their website.

                                                    Primarily I was involved with fixing pre-existing bugs and adding a few small enhancements.

Explore campus organizations, services, and read about the experiences of other students. It also has many parent resources, news about orientation week, and a place to ask any questions. Independently built from requirements while focusing heavily on accessibility.

In addition to making the site accessible, I also implemented a new layout and created an instructional guide on keeping posts accessible.

In my second week, I will attend Drupal training workshops taught by members of CCS. Then I will spend time looking through an advanced Drupal site (oweek2016) and reading the custom modules. A good measure of success is being able to quickly and effectively apply changes and additions to either STARTonline.ca, or the orientation-week website.

                                                    To finish on schedule I will:
                                                    Prioritize content. Focus finishing essential pages first. Less important content can be added later if necessary.
                                                    Do regular check-ins with Monica and Rob. Making sure to adapt to any requirement changes.
                                                    Fix accessibility issues in waves as content goes up.

                                                    The development process of a website at Sandbox went like this:
                                                    <br>1. The clients would meet with a project coordinator, designer, and a few developers where the project scope, timeline, cost and difficulty are discussed.
                                                    <br>2. The designers and developers work together to create a site map and an overview of the website.
                                                    <br>3. The designer goes through stages of creating what the site is going to look like using wireframing, paper-prototypes, and mockups. Once these have client approval they are made into PSDs.
                                                    <br>4. The Photoshop documents are given to the developers, who work their magic and produce the website in a series of development stages. Development (dev) -&gt; Testing (test) -&gt; Production (prod)
                                                    <br>5. After the developers and clients have thoroughly tested and reviews the site it is pushed live!

                                                    As a Web Developer at Sandbox, I was involved in the later, and largest stages of the project. I was given Photoshop documents (PSDs) of the designs and developed, tested and QA'ed a multitude of websites.

                                                    Work at Sandbox was on a very tight schedule. So I made sure sites were ready to go live on their scheduled deployment date.

                                                    As a developer, contact with non-developers is always a challenge.
                                                    I find it helps to write down spoken requests, so that I can schedule them in my calendar and better plan ahead to meet project deadlines.
                                                    I also learned to spend more time implementing priority issues from Project managers.

                                                    <br>
                                                    The time I spent developing at Sandbox was very beneficial to my skills at front-end web development. I'm the most proud of my speed at developing has improved.<br><br>
